GET    /classes/mine                     - Get my classes
POST   /classes/join                     - Join class by code
POST   /classes                          - Create class
```

### Dynamic Routes (Come After Static)
```
GET    /classes/:id                      - Get class details
POST   /classes/:id/assign               - Assign quiz to class
POST   /classes/:id/posts                - Create post in class
POST   /classes/:id/new-code             - Generate new code
DELETE /classes/:id                      - Delete class
DELETE /classes/:id/students/:studentId  - Remove student
GET    /classes/:id/join-requests        - Get join requests

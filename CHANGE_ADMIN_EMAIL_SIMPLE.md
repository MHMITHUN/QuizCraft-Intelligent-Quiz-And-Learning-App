   ```

## üîç What Each Email Does

| Email Type | Example | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| **Sender Email** | `teamquizcraft@gmail.com` | Sends all emails (2FA codes, verifications) |
| **Admin Email** | `mhmmithun1@gmail.com` | Receives 2FA codes to login as admin |

**Think of it like:**
- `teamquizcraft@gmail.com` = The mailman (delivers messages)
- `mhmmithun1@gmail.com` = The admin's mailbox (receives 2FA codes)

You can have:
- Admin at `boss@company.com`
- Emails sent from `teamquizcraft@gmail.com`
- Both work together!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Mistakes

### ‚ùå WRONG:
Changing `EMAIL_USERNAME` when you want to change admin
```env
EMAIL_USERNAME=newadmin@gmail.com  ‚Üê NO! This breaks email sending
```

### ‚úÖ CORRECT:
Only change `ADMIN_EMAIL`
```env
ADMIN_EMAIL=newadmin@gmail.com     ‚Üê YES! This is what you want
EMAIL_USERNAME=teamquizcraft@gmail.com  ‚Üê Keep this always
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting Current Issue

You said the app restarts after login without showing 2FA screen. Let's debug:

### Test Steps:

1. **Check backend logs** when admin logs in:
   ```bash
   # Start backend with logs visible
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Try login** with `mhmmithun1@gmail.com` / `sumya1234`

3. **Look for these logs:**
   ```
   [AuthContext] Login started for: mhmmithun1@gmail.com
   [AuthContext] Login response: { ... }
   [AuthContext] Admin 2FA detected  ‚Üê Should see this!
   [LoginScreen] Admin 2FA required, navigating...
   ```

4. **If you see errors**, copy them and we'll fix

### Quick Fix if Email Not Sending:

Check backend terminal for:
```
Admin 2FA email error: ...
```

If you see an error, it means:
- Email password is wrong
- Gmail blocked the app password
- Need to enable "Less secure app access" in Gmail

## üì± Frontend Debugging

The app should:
1. Show login screen
2. Admin enters email/password
3. **Navigate to Admin Verification screen** (6-digit code input)
4. Admin enters code from email
5. Admin is logged in

If step 3 doesn't happen, check console logs in frontend.

```bash
# Check who is admin now
npm run check-admins

# Change admin email (after editing .env)
npm run promote-to-admin

# See all commands
npm run
```

## üí° Summary

**To change admin email:**
1. Edit `ADMIN_EMAIL` in `.env`
2. Run `npm run promote-to-admin`
3. Restart backend
4. Login with new email

**Keep `EMAIL_USERNAME` and `EMAIL_PASSWORD` as `teamquizcraft@gmail.com` always!**

## 🐛 Common Issues to Check

### If results don't load:

2. Check console for errors
3. Verify historyId is being passed correctly
4. Check network tab for API response

### If data looks wrong:
1. Check if quiz has questions with options
2. Verify answers array length matches questions length
3. Check backend response format in Network tab

### If animations don't work:
1. Check React Native Animated is imported
2. Verify useEffect dependencies
3. Check animation values are initialized

## 📊 Data Format Reference

### Backend Response (`GET /api/history/:id`)
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "history": {
      "_id": "...",
      "user": {...},
      "quiz": {
        "_id": "...",
        "title": "Quiz Title",
        "questions": [
          {
            "questionText": "Question 1?",
            "options": [
              { "text": "Option A", "isCorrect": false },
              { "text": "Option B", "isCorrect": true }
            ],
            "explanation": "..."
          }
        ]
      },
      "answers": [
        {
          "questionId": "...",
          "userAnswer": "Option B",
          "isCorrect": true,
          "pointsEarned": 10
        }
      ],
      "score": 80,
      "percentage": 80,
      "totalQuestions": 10,
      "correctAnswers": 8,
      "incorrectAnswers": 2,
      "timeTaken": 120,
      "passed": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Frontend State After Transformation
```javascript
{
  answers: ["Option B", "Option C", ...],  // Simplified array
  quiz: { /* quiz data */ },
  percentage: 80,
  timeTaken: 120,
  correctAnswers: 8,

  // ... other fields
}
```
